# Luftwaffe 1940
----
“Luftwaffe 1940” is an old school arcade style game based on the World War 2. The player plays as a German aircraft pilot of the Luftwaffe (name of the German air force during WW2) against Russian soldiers armed with anti-aircraft guns. The goal is to bomb the soldiers on the ground until there is none left, and once all soldiers are eliminated, the player can move on to the next stage. At every stage, the number of enemy soldiers grows by a factor of 3, and the game gets aggressively difficult as the stages progress. The player has to be wary of how many hits his aircraft takes as 5 hits will result in elimination. The player also has to be wary of how much fuel he’s consuming, as running out of fuel also results in elimination. The graphics in the game is fluent, and every hit, explosion and death is displayed via animation.
